WordLadders 1.0

A word of caution - By no means is this code 'clean'.  In fact, this is a pretty ugly implementation.  You might even scourge at some of the distastful patterns you see.

None-the-less I really just wanted to get my path finding algorithm working. Code clean-up with be continuously going on.  

Please comment with suggestions, tips, or cruel remarks.
